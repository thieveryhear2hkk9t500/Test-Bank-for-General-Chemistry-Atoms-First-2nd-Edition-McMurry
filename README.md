Author: John E. McMurry: Robert C. Fay


***General Chemistry*** uses a building-block approach, starting with the atom and progressing through molecules and compounds to help you intuitively follow complex concepts more logically. By presenting experimental data followed by theory, the text helps you gain a deeper understanding of chemical concepts.
